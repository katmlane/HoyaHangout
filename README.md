# Hoya Hangout
This is a work-in-progress passion project of mine, created to provided Hoya lovers with some basic information about different species of the Genus Hoya. The pictures were mainly sourced, with their permission, from Doug Chamberlain of http://vermonthoyas.com/. They are photos of his personal plants.

**Link to project:** https://hoya-hangout.netlify.app

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript,

I started with selecting 12 Hoya species that I wanted to do research on and display information on. After that I structured the HTML and CSS to display my content in a way that was readable and accesible to all users.

I will add more as the project is completed.

## Optimizations
*(optional)*

I would like to add arrow buttons to each of the plant species pages that lets you navigate in the order of the home page items. 

## Lessons Learned:

With this website I learned the importance of time management and knowing when to move on from a piece of the product. 

## Examples:
Take a look at these couple examples that I have in my own portfolio:
